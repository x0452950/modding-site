# My Modding Vault

This is my personal archive of console and tech modding projects. I built this static site to document all the DIY setups I've worked on — from Android rooting to Raspberry Pi server builds.

## What's Inside

- Nexus Tablet Rooting
- 3DS Modding with Luma3DS
- PSP and PS Vita Custom Firmware
- Wii Modding with Homebrew Channel
- Minecraft Server with Plugins (Factions, Jail, etc.)
- DIY NAS using Linux and Samba
- Raspberry Pi Projects (RetroPie, Pi-hole, Media Center)
- Tools & Downloads I Use

## Deploy It Yourself

This site is completely static (pure HTML/CSS). You can host it anywhere:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify (recommended — one-click deploy)
