If you're reading this, I'm no longer around.

I don't know when you'll find this, or what you’ll be feeling when you do. Maybe sadness, maybe confusion, maybe just a quiet kind of numb. Whatever it is, I hope you know this wasn't sudden for me. I had time to think. To feel. To make peace with things in my own way.

Please don't carry guilt or what-ifs. You were enough. My leaving isn't a reflection of your love or your efforts. Life just… unfolds in ways we don’t always understand.

Take care of each other. Love boldly. Speak truthfully. And when you miss me—because I know sometimes you will—remember me in the small, quiet moments. A laugh. A favorite song. The smell of rain.

That’s where I’ll be.

A personal archive of console hacking, device modding, game hacking, server setups, and cybersecurity experiments.  
This static HTML site documents everything I’ve explored — from rooting Android devices to building enterprise-grade NIDS.
